### <div align="center">I created it using skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Framework Swiper. The tool Figma [look here](https://www.figma.com/file/oW3glk3qkXbTL68TY4XAZc/Lamborghini-race-(1)?type=design&node-id=32-45&mode=design&t=UlqMlwkvD8wtSBnB-0) was used for the website design. This site was designed to adapt to various screens, with breakpoints set at 1100px, 940px, 768px, 640px, 560px, 420px, and 375px for adaptation.</div>
